\section{Integrated stress response}

\subsection{Aspartate depletion induced ISR}
Aspartate depletion is achieved in GOT DKO cells and shown to cause integrated stress response (ISR) both through eIF2a phosphorylation and ATF4 upregulation.
Media swapping induces a quick depletion of both Asp and Asn.
Asn efflux is likely more quick due to better permeability.
Upon Asn depletion the ISR cascade starts and can maintain high expression of ATF4 due to the continued Asn synthesis from Asp.
On the other hand, if Asp is depleted to the point of protein synthesis inhibition no signal might be detected when probing ATF4 as Asp levels will not recover.
We observe these dynamics clearly in HT1080 GOT DKO cells in figures \ref{fig:sapp:ISR:HT1080_DKO_ISR} and \ref{fig:sapp:ISR:HT1080_DKO_ASPtit_time}.
Especially, the ATF4 reporter shows the kinetics of these Asp/Asn depletion kinetics.

For 143B GOT DKO we observe similar results.
Here, inhibition of GCN2 ablates ATF4 expression while mitochondrial respiration (missing in rho0 cells) is not required for ATF4 upregulation.

\subsection{OMA1/HRI relation to rotenone/antimycin induced ISR}
According Fessler et al. and Guo et al. \cite{Fessler2020-zk, Guo2020-ia} OMA1/HRI is required for FCCP induced ISR.
Guo et al. also shows OMA1/HRI is required for rotenone/antimycin induced ISR (suppl. of Guo et al.).

We have knockout cells (parental HT1080 ATF reporter low clone) of OMA1 and HRI.
These appear to ablate rotenone/antimycin induced ISR but strangely not FCCP induced ISR.
This could be due to pleiotropic effect of FCCP e.g. its is also depolarizing the plasma membrane and the lysosomal membrane.

\subsection{OMA1/HRI relation to asp depletion induced ISR}
OMA1 KO appears on western blot to ablate ATF4 upregulation in response to aspartate depletion; however, HRI does not.
Another experiment, exclusively with OMA1, shows that it is not required for ATF4 upregulation after aspartate depletion while GCN2 is.

\subsection{ASNS over-expression to ablate rotenone/antimycin induced ISR}
If asparagine depletion is the main reason for rotenone/antimycin induced ISR maybe over-expression of ASNS would mitigate it?
Using the HT1080 ATF4 reporter cells (low baseline clone) ASNS and eGFP (control) was over-expressed using lentiviral infection.
The polyclonal population that grew out after selection was tested for ATF4 upregulation using reporter assay and western blot.
Generally, ASNS over-expression diminish ATF4 upregulation, but strangely, in this background, adding additional asparagine increase ATF4.

\subsection{GCN2 relation to rotenone induced ISR in 293T}
Now, one would think that ETC inhibitor induced ISR is induced through Asp/Asn depletion and thus mediated by GCN2 and thus a GCN2 knockout should not upregulate ATF4.
We only have a confirmed GCN2 knockout in 293T cells and therefore tried with these.
Strangely, ISR in 293T cells was not reverted well with Asp/Asn, but even more strange the GCN2 KO cells did not have ablated ATF4.
