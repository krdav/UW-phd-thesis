Aspartate is typically coupled to NAD+/NADH ratio and thus if one is changed the other one is changed proportionally an vice versa.
Therefore it could be compelling to think that aspartate levels correlate with proliferation only indirectly through the NAD+/NADH ratio.
However, we have evidence against this:
Lucas' previous papers
My NAD+/NADH experiment with 143B SLC1A3 cells
Maddie's paper on SHDB which shows the opposite trend i.e. increased cytoplasmic NAD+/NADH ratio (due to media pyruvate) but are still aspartate limited
